# Landing Page
The aim is to create a landing page using HTML, CSS and then intriducing PHP and Javascript. You can use any colours / theme you like but your layout should follow this conventional layout. 
It can either be about something you love or about a product/item to sell. Use this opportunity to get creative! ðŸ¤©

Some common landing pages ideas could be

- Fitness
- Personal Portfolio
- Sports team
- Music
- Retro gaming
- Something else
