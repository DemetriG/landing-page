# Landing Page
the aim is to create a landing page using html and css, csn sll be done on 1 file if you like, or if you are feeling braver, you can split off the css files and link them in the html header.

You can use any colours / theme you like.  Your layout should follow this conventional layout.

### Follow these steps
- Create an index.html file somewhere on your machine
- add the `<html></html>` tags
- add a `<head></head>` section in the html
- add a `<body></body>` section underneath the head
- add a `header` with a logo in it (any image you like)
- add a `navigation` with at least 2 links (they dont have to go anywhere)
- add a `content` or `section` area that will be the main body of your landing page
- add a `footer` underneath everything with a couple of links for "contact us" an "careers" (they dont have to go anywhere)
- add a `sidebar` section to go next to the main content on either the left or right had side
